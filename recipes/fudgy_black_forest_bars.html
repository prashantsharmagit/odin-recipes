  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>
    These fudgy Black Forest bars are a decadent dessert that is somewhere
    between brownie and cake, loaded with chocolate and bathed in cherries.
    They're fabulous with coffee.
  </p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 cup salted butter, softened</li>
    <li>1 1/2 cups white sugar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
    <li>4 large eggs</li>
    <li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
    <li>1/2 cup unsweetened triple chocolate baking cocoa</li>
    <li>1 large dark chocolate bar, chopped into chunks (about 1 cup chunks)</li>
    <li>1 (21 ounce) can cherry pie filling</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon confectioners sugar (optional)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Directions</h2>

    <li>
      <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line 2 (10x15-inch)

    </li>
