          Mix butter and tahini in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium
          speed until combined, about 30 seconds. Add brown sugar, vanilla,
          baking powder, and salt. Mix at medium speed, scraping sides of bowl
          as needed, 1 minute. Stir in flour until combined. Chill, covered, at
          least 2 hours or up to 12 hours.

          Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). Line 2 (10x15-inch)
          baking sheets with parchment paper. Place sesame seeds in a small
          bowl.

          Roll dough into 1 1/4-inch balls. Dip tops of balls in sesame seeds to
          lightly coat; arrange 1 1/2 inches apart on prepared baking sheets.
        </p>

          Bake in the preheated oven until bottoms are light brown, about 12
          minutes. Let cool on cookie sheets 2 minutes. Transfer cookies to wire
          racks; let cool completely. Store cookies in an airtight container at
          room temperature up to 5 days.
